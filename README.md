    <td>Chris helped out with the backend development on a couple of projects, this included work on a headless Drupal site for the New York Lottery.

  He has good attention to detail when it comes to tasks and has a creative approach to solving challenges on the project. His experience with Drupal 8 and the various APIs that Drupal provides is solid....</td>

    <td>I worked with Chris on a very complex website powered by a headless configuration of Drupal. He was extremely knowledgeable, and very accommodating of the clients' changing requests. I always felt secure knowing that Chris was on the project when a request would come through regarding the backend of the site. I highly recommend him, he is probably the best Drupal developer I have ever worked with. ðŸ¤©</td>

    <td>Chris developed our Drupal 7 module that was based on an unfinished API spec. Even with the spec in constant flux he created what we wanted. We then asked for a Drupal 8 version and he delivered it in record time. He is easy to work with, and was communicative throughout the process. I would recommend Chris for any Drupal work.</td>

    <td>I was on Chris' team at The American College. Chris brought an extremely strong knowledge of Drupal to a development team that had almost none and made a huge impact almost immediately. Known for taking work home, he did what it took to complete things in a timely fashion and once he got down into a project you practically had to rip him away. He was a leading factor in implementing continuous integration practices as well as a driving force in bringing agile development to The College. It was a pleasure working with Chris as his knowledge was always cutting edge in an array of areas from JavaScript to Drupal/PHP to best practices and CI and his drive and thirst was easily contagious.</td>
